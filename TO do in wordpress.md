Now, anywhere in your WordPress content, you can add this shortcode:

\\ Use this for login button
[pi_login_button]

OR
\\Use this for payment button
[pi_pay_now]

It will render the Pi login button and tie into our frontend JavaScript logic.



💅 Bonus: Styling the Button (Optional)
You can toss this into your theme’s CSS or enqueue it via the plugin later:

css
.pi-login-button {
    background-color: #8B3DFF;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    font-size: 16px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
}
That’s our full login loop nearly complete: shortcode → button → Pi SDK → backend → saved user. 🔁 Want to give it a quick test in the Pi Browser, or shall we build out the next feature—maybe wallet display or payment handling? 🔄💸



Fantastic! 🎉 You're now ready to test the full Pi Network login flow in your WordPress site.

✅ Here's What Should Happen
You insert [pi_login_button] anywhere on a page or post.

A "Login with Pi Network" button appears.

Inside the Pi Browser, clicking the button triggers Pi.authenticate().

Once authorized, the Pi username is sent via AJAX to your WordPress backend.

WordPress either creates a new user or updates the existing one.

A success message appears — and boom, you're connected!

🧪 Test Tips
This will only work inside the Pi Browser, since the SDK depends on its environment.

For live testing later, switch sandbox: false in your JS.

Check your WordPress Users list to confirm that new accounts are being created.
